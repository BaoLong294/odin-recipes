    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce.</p>
    <p>
      The dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki, where
      meat is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic,
        ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring
        frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes.
        Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of
        each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with
        remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run
        clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
