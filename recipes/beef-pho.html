    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Many people get hooked on Vietnamese food after trying pho — a heady bowl
      of spiced broth with flat, tangly rice noodles, a featured protein topping
      of your choice, green onions, and herbs. Each pho cook has their own
      formula for seasoning and crafting the broth and toppings.

      Diners get to personalize their pho noodle soup at the table by adding
      various kinds of condiments, herbs, and sometimes bean sprouts too. It's a
      quintessential have-it-your-way dish. Beef pho (pho bo) is most common but
      there are many kinds of pho.
