      <h2>Steps</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
          C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain canned pineapple into a 1-cup measure. Add water if needed to
          measure 1 cup. Set aside juice and 9 pineapple rings for the cake. Set
          any remaining juice and pineapple rings aside for another use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          While butter is melting, combine cake mix, reserved 1 cup pineapple
          juice, vegetable oil, and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Beat with an
          electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove melted butter from the heat and sprinkle brown sugar evenly
          over top until all the butter is covered. Arrange 8 pineapple rings
          around the outer edge of the skillet and place the remaining pineapple
          ring in the center without overlapping. Place a maraschino cherry into
          the center of each pineapple ring; pour cake batter on top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake
          comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes; don't
          let the cake cool too much or it will stick to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run an offset spatula around the edges to gently loosen cake. Place a
          plate over the skillet, then flip and carefully turn the warm cake out
          onto a plate. Transfer any fruit or glaze that sticks in the skillet
          back to the cake.
