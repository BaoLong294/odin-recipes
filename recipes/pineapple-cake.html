      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain canned pineapple into a 1-cup measure. Add water if needed to
            measure 1 cup. Set aside juice and 9 pineapple rings for the cake.
            Set any remaining juice and pineapple rings aside for another use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            While butter is melting, combine cake mix, reserved 1 cup pineapple
            juice, vegetable oil, and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Beat with an
            electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove melted butter from the heat and sprinkle brown sugar evenly
            over top until all the butter is covered. Arrange 8 pineapple rings
            around the outer edge of the skillet and place the remaining
            pineapple ring in the center without overlapping. Place a maraschino
            cherry into the center of each pineapple ring; pour cake batter on
            top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake
            comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the oven and let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes;
            don't let the cake cool too much or it will stick to the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run an offset spatula around the edges to gently loosen cake. Place
            a plate over the skillet, then flip and carefully turn the warm cake
            out onto a plate. Transfer any fruit or glaze that sticks in the
            skillet back to the cake.
          </li>
