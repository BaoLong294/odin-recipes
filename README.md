Recipes Project - HTML Foundations

I used the following skills to complete this project:

- Creating and navigating directories using the Ubuntu CLI
- Understanding HTML Boilerplate
- Creating links using the anchor tag combined with the href attribute
- Adding images using the img tag combined with src and alt attributes
- Creating headings and both ordered and unordered lists
- Interacting with Git using commands like git status, git add, and git commit
- Pushing commits to GitHub using git push origin main
